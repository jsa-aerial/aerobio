 "utility that finds significant changes in transcript expression, splicing, and promoter use. Finds differentially expressed genes and transcripts, as well as genes that are being differentially regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Also groups transcripts into biologically meaningful groups, such as transcripts that share the same transcription start site (TSS), in order to identify genes that are differentially regulated at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level."
