 "utility that assembles transcripts and estimates their abundances in RNA-seq samples. It accepts aligned RNA-seq reads, then assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts, reporting as few full-length transcript fragments [transfrags] as are needed to explain the data. Cufflinks then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one."
