Usage aerobio <cmd> <action|compfile | aggrfile> {replicates | combined} <eid>

cmd is one of 'check', 'run', 'status', 'compare', 'xcompare or 'aggregate'

- 'check' is for pre-validation of an experiment configuration. It performs
  existence, integrity and consistency checks across all sheets.

- 'run' performs a job phase execution (see phase descriptions below)

- 'status' performs a realtime check of the current state of a previously
  requested job run.

- 'compare' is used for subsequent comparison runs

- 'xcompare' is used for cross experiment comparison

- 'aggregate' is used for Tn-Seq 'super aggregation'


The 'status' command has the same form as the command it is checking, with
'run', 'compare', 'xcompare', or 'aggregate' replaced by 'status'.

For example, the run command:

aerobio run phase-1 181013_NS500751_0092_AH57C5BGX9

can have its progress checked by issuing:

aerobio status phase-1 181013_NS500751_0092_AH57C5BGX9


The 'check' command takes just the EID of an associated experiment
configuration:

aerobio check 181013_NS500751_0092_AH57C5BGX9

It will perform all validation checks associated with the sheets describing
the experiment run configuration, and report success or any errors found.


actions go with 'run'; compfiles go with 'compare' or 'xcompare' and
aggrfiles go with 'aggregate': THESE ARE ALL MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE!

An action is one of the standard 'phases':
  - phase-0
    1. runs bcl2fastq
    2. create directory structure, initialize scratch space, and copies fastqs
    3. collect and save barcode statistics for demultiplexing fastqs
    4. create experiment database and all records computed from the *Sheets
    5. QC filter and demultiplex Illumina fastqs into sample condition fastqs
    6. for tnseq only : runs collapser on split fastqs

  - phase-0b
    * Everything in phase-0 except bcl2fastq step. Supports manual bcl2fastq

  - phase-0c
    * Steps 3-5 of phase-0 for RNA-Seq and 3-6 of phase-0 for Tn-Seq

  - phase-0d
    * Step 5 of phase-0 (only for RNA-Seq)

  - phase-1 or star-phase-1 (for RNA-Seq, Tn-Seq, and Term-Seq)
    1. runs bowtie2 or STAR alignment streaming to samtools step 2
    2. samtools conversion from bowtie/STAR sam output to bam output streaming
       to step 3
    3. samtools sort of bam streaming to steps 4 and 5
    4. samtools indexing (bai files)
    5. write bams

    Additionally for Tn-Seq:
    1. concurrently runs separate bowtie1 on collapsed fasta files streaming
       SAM to mapper
    2. mapper takes streaming SAM converting and writing simplified map output
       files

  - phase-2 RNA-Seq
    1. runs featureCounts on comparison sheets
    2. Runs an initial Dseq2 analysis
       * Generates a DGE csv with all data for any subsequent work
       * Generates several 'default' plots from this csv

  - phase-2 Tn-Seq
    1. runs fitness calculation on pairs of map files
    2. runs aggregation on the results

  - phase-2 WG-Seq
    1. Runs a 'streaming fork/join' flow of Bre-Seq on QC filtered
       demultiplexed fastq.gzs (10 threads)

A 'compfile' is the name of a comparison file detailing comparisons to be made

'replicates' applies only to phase-1/star-phase-1 and indicates replicate
bam generation. This is the default. To run with combined results, use
'combined'

'eid' is the experiment id
