Aerobio is a system for creating services and connecting them together to form jobs. A service defines a piece of computation and may be implemented by external tooling or code specific to the computation involved. A job defines a directed acyclical graph (DAG) composed of service nodes and data stream edges. Nodes may have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Both services and jobs are specified entirely by data (EDN or JSON). Jobs are realized by instantiating the node processing as (OS level) threads of execution and the streaming connections as aysnchronous channels. A realized job is roughly equivalent to the notion of a 'pipeline'.
