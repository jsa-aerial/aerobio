##### FITNESS CALCULATIONS #####


# Calculates the correction factors for reads from t1 and t2; cfactor1
# and cfactor2 are the number of reads from t1 and t2 respectively
# divided by total, which is the average number of reads between the
# two. This is used later on to correct for pipetting errors, or any
# other error that would cause unequal amounts of DNA from t1 and t2
# to be sequenced so that an unequal amount of reads is produced
